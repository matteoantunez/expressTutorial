# expressTutorial Repo - Matteo Antunez
This repo is following a tutorial create by Mozilla in regards to express app Development. This is a TUTORIAL, so there is not much 'unquiness' to the file.
This repo is different because I have the app in one folder presented in the repo. When running the code, make sure to run the following code to run the site.
 
  cd express-locallibrary-tutorial  
  SET DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:* 
  npm start
